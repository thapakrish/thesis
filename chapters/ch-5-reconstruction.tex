%\subsection{Event Selection and Reconstruction}

\chapter{Event Reconstruction} \label{ch:reconstruction}

%Something about the event reconstruction.
%Data streams to slink and histograms.

PLT reports the online luminosity value by using the fast-or dataset. Slink data is used offline to parametrize the events and look for corrections to be applied to the luminosity value. In this chapter, reconstructions of events from each PLT data streams is described. Section \ref{sec:telAlign} describes the method used to find the correct alignment of each telescope which is done before track reconstruction. Section \ref{sec:fastor} and section \ref{sec:slink} describe the reconstruction of event from fast-or and slink data.



\section{Telescope Alignment} \label{sec:telAlign}

%for fastor: about per bin, leakage to neighboring bin, etc.
%for slink:write something about alignment to motivate tracks, beamspots
%slink to further characterize the fastor, and provide for extra correction.

%Since PLT is an online luminometer, the luminosity value reported by PLT is from the fast-or data, which uses the zero-counting algorithm. 

PLT data is saved in granular level via the slink streams for offline analysis. Each hit is saved according to its channel number, bunch number, plane number and the pixel within the plane. In the plane's coordinate system, each pixel can be identified by its row and column number where each row is $150 \mu m$ and each column is $100 \mu m$. This is akin to just the first quarter of cartesian coordinate system with (0, 0) representing plane's leftmost pixel from the lowest row. 

% For this data to be useful, however, knowledge of the correct position of each telescope is equally important. 

Each telescope's position with respect to the CMS coordinate system is known beforehand. In the telescope coordinate system, midpoints of planes 0, 1, 2, are positioned at (0, 0, 0), (0, 0.102, 3.77), and (0, 0.204, 7.54) respectively. Hit positions from each plane are then translated to the CMS coordinate system with (0, 0, 0) at the interaction point to look for patterns in measurement data.


A set of hits that pass through all three planes and assumed to be the trace of a moving charged particle are referred to as tracks. This is analogous the triple coincidence criteria set for fast-or but with few differences. Unlike fast-or, which uses the zero-counting algorithm, tracking algorithm is designed to make multiple tracks from the set of hits and clusters of hits in plane 0, 1, and 2. 
 
For alignment purpose, only the "cleanest" set of tracks are considered, namely the tracks with only 1 hit in plane 0, 1, and 2 each. As a reference, the "ideal" alignment file is used and the tracking algorithm is applied to sets of hits passing the triple-hit criteria. Under the ideal assumption, a good track would hit same pixels (rows, columns) in each plane shifted by the predefined alignment of the PLT planes. Tracking algorithm makes the best fit to the three hits in each plane of a telescope, and the residuals are calculated for each such tracks. This step is repeated for a large number of tracks and the deviation from the ideal alignment is calculated to generate a final translated alignment file for each data taking period.

%to find the alignment for each telescope during each data taking period. 
%...Eventually, the correction to be applied to the ideal alignment is calculated using the slopes and residuals via the "rotational residuals."...

%, and a correction to the supposed position of each track is made.

%In particular, we define a "track" as a set of events in a telescope for a given BX (each BX is $25 ns$ long), when all three planes register at least 1 hit. This definition is entirely dependent on the way we "align" our telescopes and planes in global coordinate system.

\section{Fast-or triple fold coincidences} \label{sec:fastor}
% perLS
%
Fast-or data stream saves coincidence count for each channel in a form of histogram where the bunch is the bin number. Each histogram gets cleared every nibble (4096 orbits) and sent downstream to be converted to a luminosity value. For each orbit, depending on the number of bunches that are made to collide, each telescope is likely to receive only a few triple-coincidences. Figure \ref{fig:pBXfor} shows coincidence count for all telescopes for Fill 4444 from 2015 in a logy scale, with tall bins representing the filled bunches.
%If we were to look at just the total number of triple coincidences per BX, we see a clear pattern emerging. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:pBXfor}, most of the collision events happen for a filled BX.

\end{figure}


For every bunch crossing, only ... are likely to collide as seen in Figure \ref{fig:pileup}. Out of those colliding particles, PLT is expected to receive only some because of the detector's rapidity location, and acceptance region. Each histogram for a given telescope, at the end of a nibble period, receives only around 300 coincidences out of 4096 orbits as shown in figure \ref{fig:pBXfor}. The coincidence count is the boolean count of whether there was some coincidence or not.  For each telescope, coincidence count (N) is then translated to luminosity value via the zero-counting algorithm in the form of $-log((4096-N)/4096)$. 

%What is the average coincidence count per BX for all telescopes?

\subsubsection{Contribution from non-colliding bunches}
As seen in Figure \ref{fig:pBXfor}, coincidences are also recorded for non-colliding bunches. This contribution could be from the background, secondary interactions, or spill-over from preceding bins. 

%The contributions from these non-colliding bunches were studied and their half-life was calculated

\end{figure}



Figure \ref{fig:forLT} shows the exponential decay in contribution as a function of separation between bunches. The first non-colliding bunch is at ~0.1\% of the preceding colliding bunch. Except for the first non-colliding BX immediately after filled BX, exponential drop (defined by tau of $\approx$ 90 BX) can be seen for all gaps. As such, contributions from non-colliding bunches is extremely low.







\section{Slink Tracks} \label{sec:slink}

%\subsubsection{Reconstruction}

As described in section \ref{ssec:trigger}, slink is designed to save only some of the hit information based on some predefined trigger setup. Fig. \ref{fig:pBXslink} shows the number of tracks  per bunch crossing. The tall towers represent the colliding bunches and the rest are the non-filled bunches. Contribution from non-filled BX is very low.
%Slink data is saved in a binary format that can be used in "offline" analysis. 

%Each event in slink data contains information about the hit on a pixel on a plane. Each plane is a member of a telescope, which is a member of +Z/-Z sides of telescopes. Furthermore, each telescope and thus the plane has it's own orientation in the global coordinates.

    \caption{nTracks (log) per BX, Fill 4444 (2015) at random trigger.}
      \label{fig:pBXslink}
\end{figure}

Given a set of hits on a set of planes, the tracking algorithm is used as described in \ref{sec:telAlign} to make tracks which can then be used to parametrize the measurement dataset. For each track, reconstruction of slopes and residuals in x and y-direction, and the beam spot position are described below.

%\end{figure}







\subsubsection{Track Slopes}

The best fit line drawn for a set of hits on 3 planes have slopes that are defined by the geometry of the PLT. Since the telescopes are placed at some angle to the interaction point in the y-direction of the CMS coordinate system, the mean y-slope centers around the PLT global position. At the same time, x-slope is centered around 0 because there is no preferred direction for a track to go in the x direction. Figure \ref{fig:44slopes} shows the x and y slopes for a sample of tracks. Slope-y is centered around $0.027$ and slope-x is centered around $0.0$ as expected. 

%To get the slope, hits from three different planes are aligned and a best-fit line is drawn.

% plot occupies large space: scale y

    \caption{Reconstruction of slope-x and slope-y.}
     \label{fig:44slopes}
\end{figure}

%%%%describe tracking algorithm?
%We define a track as some straight line, passing through the coordinates of each pixel on three planes. We then draw a best fit straight line to three 3 coordinates (or 2 because z is fixed), and extrapolate the straight line back to IP (because we know where the midpoint of straight line from plane 1 to plane 2 is), we get slope, and go back to negzMiddlePlane and find the x,y,z point on z=0 plane.
%%
%So, this track now has 3 variables, (x at z=0,y at z=0,slope-x,slope-y,residual-x,residual-y) with these variables, we can find out where the hit happened in each plane. In fact, since we know the global position of each telescope, slope and residuals themselves are enough to characterising everything about the track, given that we know which telescope this track came from.
%%
%So, the most independent variables that we are interested in are slopes and residuals.
%%

%We take the three hits on three different planes (select these only), and extrapolate


\subsubsection{Track Beamspot}
Beam spot is defined as the position of the track in the x-y plane at the interaction point i.e. at z=0 in CMS coordinate system. Figure \ref{fig:44beamspots} shows the beam spot(cm) seen by the telescopes in both sides of the interaction point from Fill 4444, 2015.  The inner blue ring is an ellipse drawn such that major and minor axis represent $3 \sigma$ of x and y mean separately. The center of the ellipse is positioned at $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$. Most of the tracks seem to be coming from within 2.25 cm of the IP, the beampipe size.  The "arms" arise due to the acceptance region of individual telescopes, which is not quite symmetric due to the absence of two telescopes on one side. 
%Since 2 telescopes in one side were not taking any data, two arms on the first quadrant seem blurred.


%Beam spot:  track's extrapolation to (x,y) values on z=0 plane. 8 arms arise due to the acceptance region of individual telescopes.

     \label{fig:44beamspots}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Track Residuals}
Residuals from each track in x and y directions are just the absolute distance between the best of fit line and the position of hits in each plane. Fig. \ref{fig:44residuals} shows the x and y residuals for a sample of tracks with a landau-like shape with long tails. The high peak near 0 means that most of the tracks have small residual i.e. the hits of tracks and their best fit line are not very far off. This makes sense because the charged particles have very little time to shift directions in between planes. The discreteness in pixel size, however, introduces some smearing into the residuals. The number of tracks with larger than 3mm residual is extremely low as shown in figure \ref{fig:44residuals}.

%Slope-y, is centered around $0.027$ and slope-x is centered around $0.0$ as expected.
